# Google Cloud Client Libraries for .NET

The Google Cloud Client Libraries for .NET support accessing Google
Cloud Platform services in a way that significantly reduces the
boilerplate code you have to write. The libraries provide high-level
API abstractions so they're easier to understand. They embrace
idioms of C#, work well with the standard library, and integrates
better with your codebase. All this means you spend more time
creating code that matters to you.

General articles are linked at the top of the page. These give
background reading to help you make the most of any of the APIs
supported here.
